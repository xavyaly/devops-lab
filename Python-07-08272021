# Python Programming

Question: 6

Define a class which has at least two methods:

getString: to get a string from console input
printString: to print the string in upper case.

Also please include simple test function to test the class methods.

Hints:
Use init method to construct some parameters

Solution:

# Definition of self: 
'''self represents the instance of the class. 
By using the “self” keyword we can access the attributes and methods of the class in python. It binds the attributes with the given arguments. 
The reason you need to use self. is because Python does not use the @ syntax to refer to instance attributes.'''

Question: 7

Write a program which takes 2 digits, X,Y as input and generates a 2-dimensional array. The element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i*j.
Note: i=0,1.., X-1; j=0,1...,Y-1.

Example
Suppose the following inputs are given to the program:
3,5
Then, the output of the program should be:
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]]

Hints:
Note: In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input in a comma-separated form.

Solution:

# [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,]  # SINGLE DIMENTIONAL 
# [[1,2,3,4,5],[6,7,8,9,8],[7,6,5,4,3]]  # 2-D 

>>> a=input()
3,5
>>> dim=[int(x) for x in a.split(',')]
>>> dim
[3, 5]
>>> rowL=dim[0]
>>> colL=dim[1]
>>> rowL
3
>>> colL
5
>>> 
>>> multi=[[0 for col in range(colL)] for row in range(rowL)]
>>> multi
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
>>> 
>>> for row in range(rowL):
...     for col in range(colL):
...             multi[row][col]=row*col
... 
>>> print(multi)
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]]
>>>

Question: 8
Write a program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
without,hello,bag,world
Then, the output should be:
bag,hello,without,world

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

Solution:

>>> item=[i for i in input().split(',')]
hello,items,bag,school
>>> item
['hello', 'items', 'bag', 'school']
>>> item.sort()
>>> item
['bag', 'hello', 'items', 'school']
>>> print(','.join(item))
bag,hello,items,school
>>> 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question: 9

Write a program that accepts sequence of lines as input and prints the lines after making all characters in the sentence capitalized.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
Hello world
Practice makes perfect
Then, the output should be:
HELLO WORLD
PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

Solution:





Question:
Write a program that accepts a sequence of whitespace separated words as input and prints the words after removing all duplicate words and sorting them alphanumerically.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
hello world and practice makes perfect and hello world again
Then, the output should be:
again and hello makes perfect practice world

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.
We use set container to remove duplicated data automatically and then use sorted() to sort the data.

Solution:





Question:
Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma separated 4 digit binary numbers as its input and then check whether they are divisible by 5 or not. The numbers that are divisible by 5 are to be printed in a comma separated sequence.
Example:
0100,0011,1010,1001
Then the output should be:
1010
Notes: Assume the data is input by console.

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

Solution:





Question:
Write a program, which will find all such numbers between 1000 and 3000 (both included) such that each digit of the number is an even number.
The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

Solution:





Question:
Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of letters and digits.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
hello world! 123
Then, the output should be:

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
Hello world!
Then, the output should be:
